    - 🔑 Key: [survey], [Generalist Virtual Agent], [GVA], [autonomous agents], [digital platforms]
    - 📖 TLDR: This survey introduces the concept of Generalist Virtual Agents (GVAs), autonomous entities designed to operate across various digital platforms and environments to assist users in performing diverse tasks. It traces the evolution of GVAs from early intelligent assistants to modern implementations incorporating large-scale models, discussing their philosophical foundations, development challenges, and current methodologies. The paper provides a detailed taxonomy of GVA environments, tasks, and capabilities, aiming to bridge theoretical and practical aspects and suggesting that agents operating in environments closely mirroring the real world are more likely to exhibit human-like intelligence.

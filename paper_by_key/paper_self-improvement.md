    - 🔑 Key: [self-improvement], [self-improve]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to enhance their performance as web agents through self-improvement. Utilizing the WebArena benchmark, the authors fine-tune LLMs on synthetic training data, achieving a 31% improvement in task completion rates. They also introduce novel evaluation metrics to assess the performance, robustness, and quality of the fine-tuned agents' trajectories.

    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces *Cradle*, a framework designed to achieve General Computer Control (GCC) by enabling agents to perform any computer task using only screen images (and possibly audio) as input and producing keyboard and mouse operations as output. The authors deploy Cradle in the complex AAA game Red Dead Redemption II, demonstrating its capability to follow the main storyline and complete real missions with minimal reliance on prior knowledge or resources.

    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [model], [general computer control], [skill curation], [self-improvement]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces the Cradle framework, designed to enable general computer control (GCC) through multimodal input (e.g., screen images and optional audio) and outputs (keyboard and mouse). Cradle’s six core modules, including self-reflection, skill curation, and memory, allow for generalized task handling in complex environments like AAA games. Demonstrated in *Red Dead Redemption II*, the framework exhibits adaptability by performing real missions and following the storyline with minimal prior knowledge, showcasing its potential as a generalist agent for diverse computer tasks.

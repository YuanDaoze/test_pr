    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [Sugilite], [programming-by-demonstration]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces *Sugilite*, an intelligent task automation agent that learns new tasks and associated concepts interactively from users' natural language instructions and demonstrations on third-party mobile app GUIs. The system allows users to teach procedures and concepts through verbal instructions combined with GUI demonstrations, supports intent clarification for demonstrated actions, infers task parameters using hierarchical app GUI structures, and generalizes taught concepts across different contexts and domains. A prototype is presented as a conversational assistant on Android. [oai_citation_attribution:0‡ACL Anthology](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-demos.25/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- [PUMICE: A Multi-Modal Agent that Learns Concepts and Conditionals from Natural Language and Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00031)

    - 📅 Date: August 30, 2019
    - 📑 Publisher: UIST 2019
    - 💻 Env: [Mobile]
    - 🔑 Key: [programming-by-demonstration], [PUMICE]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces *PUMICE*, a multi-modal agent that combines natural language programming and programming-by-demonstration to enable end users to instruct intelligent agents in performing new tasks. By allowing users to describe tasks and conditions naturally and then collaboratively resolving ambiguities through conversation and demonstration, PUMICE facilitates the teaching of new concepts and procedures within existing mobile app GUIs. A lab study with 10 users demonstrated its usability and effectiveness.

- [SUGILITE: Creating Multimodal Smartphone Automation by Demonstration](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025483)

    - 💻 Env: [Mobile]
    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [PBD], [multimodal interaction], [SUGILITE], [programming-by-demonstration], [demonstration]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces *SUGILITE*, a programming-by-demonstration (PBD) system that enables users to automate tasks on smartphones through multimodal interactions. By leveraging Android's accessibility API, SUGILITE allows users to create generalized automation scripts for arbitrary third-party apps by demonstrating tasks using the regular app UI. The system combines verbal instructions, user demonstrations, and app UI hierarchies to generalize scripts from single demonstrations, facilitating task variations and parameterization. Extensive error handling and context checking enhance robustness against app UI changes. A lab study indicates that users with minimal programming knowledge can successfully automate smartphone tasks using SUGILITE.

    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces *Iris*, a visual agent designed to enhance GUI automation by addressing challenges in high-resolution, complex digital environments. It employs two key innovations: **Information-Sensitive Cropping (ISC)**, which dynamically identifies and prioritizes visually dense regions using an edge detection algorithm for efficient processing, and **Self-Refining Dual Learning (SRDL)**, which enhances the agent's ability to handle complex tasks through a dual-learning loop that iteratively refines its performance without requiring additional annotated data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Iris achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks with only 850K GUI annotations, outperforming methods using ten times more training data.

    - 🔑 Key: [model], [dataset], [planning], [reasoning], [Aguvis], [visual grounding]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces *Aguvis*, a unified pure vision-based framework for autonomous GUI agents that operates across various platforms. It leverages image-based observations and grounds natural language instructions to visual elements, employing a consistent action space to ensure cross-platform generalization. The approach integrates explicit planning and reasoning within the model, enhancing its ability to autonomously navigate and interact with complex digital environments. A large-scale dataset of GUI agent trajectories is constructed, incorporating multimodal reasoning and grounding. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Aguvis surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in both offline and real-world online scenarios, achieving the first fully autonomous pure vision GUI agent capable of performing tasks independently without collaboration with external closed-source models. All datasets, models, and training recipes are open-sourced to facilitate future research.

    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces UGround, a universal visual grounding model for GUI agents that enables human-like navigation of digital interfaces. The authors advocate for GUI agents with human-like embodiment that perceive the environment entirely visually and take pixel-level actions. UGround is trained on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 10M GUI elements across 1.3M screenshots. Evaluated on six benchmarks spanning grounding, offline, and online agent tasks, UGround significantly outperforms existing visual grounding models by up to 20% absolute. Agents using UGround achieve comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art agents that rely on additional textual input, demonstrating the feasibility of vision-only GUI agents.

    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces MM1.5, a family of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) ranging from 1B to 30B parameters, including dense and mixture-of-experts variants. MM1.5 enhances capabilities in text-rich image understanding, visual referring and grounding, and multi-image reasoning. The authors employ a data-centric training approach, utilizing high-quality OCR data and synthetic captions for continual pre-training, alongside an optimized visual instruction-tuning data mixture for supervised fine-tuning. Specialized variants, MM1.5-Video and MM1.5-UI, are designed for video understanding and mobile UI comprehension, respectively. Extensive empirical studies provide insights into the training processes, offering guidance for future MLLM development.

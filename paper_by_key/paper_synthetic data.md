    - 📖 TLDR: The *EDGE* framework proposes an innovative approach to improve GUI understanding and interaction capabilities in vision-language models through large-scale, multi-granularity synthetic data generation. By leveraging webpage data, EDGE minimizes the need for manual annotations and enhances the adaptability of models across desktop and mobile GUI environments. Evaluations show its effectiveness in diverse GUI-related tasks, contributing significantly to autonomous agent development in GUI navigation and interaction.

    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces UGround, a universal visual grounding model for GUI agents that enables human-like navigation of digital interfaces. The authors advocate for GUI agents with human-like embodiment that perceive the environment entirely visually and take pixel-level actions. UGround is trained on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 10M GUI elements across 1.3M screenshots. Evaluated on six benchmarks spanning grounding, offline, and online agent tasks, UGround significantly outperforms existing visual grounding models by up to 20% absolute. Agents using UGround achieve comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art agents that rely on additional textual input, demonstrating the feasibility of vision-only GUI agents.

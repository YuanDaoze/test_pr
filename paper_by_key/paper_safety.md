    - 📅 Date: Nov 4, 2024
    - 📑 Publisher: arXiv
    - 💻 Env: [GUI]
    - 🔑 Key: [attack], [adversarial pop-ups], [VLM agents], [safety]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper demonstrates that vision-language model (VLM) agents can be easily deceived by carefully designed adversarial pop-ups, leading them to perform unintended actions such as clicking on these pop-ups instead of completing their assigned tasks. Integrating these pop-ups into environments like OSWorld and VisualWebArena resulted in an average attack success rate of 86% and a 47% decrease in task success rate. Basic defense strategies, such as instructing the agent to ignore pop-ups or adding advertisement notices, were found to be ineffective against these attacks.

    - 💻 Env: [Web]
    - 🔑 Key: [safety], [black-box attack], [adversarial prompter model], [Direct Policy Optimization]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper presents AdvWeb, a black-box attack framework that exploits vulnerabilities in vision-language model (VLM)-powered web agents by injecting adversarial prompts directly into web pages. Using Direct Policy Optimization (DPO), AdvWeb trains an adversarial prompter model that can mislead agents into executing harmful actions, such as unauthorized financial transactions, while maintaining high stealth and control. Extensive evaluations reveal that AdvWeb achieves high success rates across multiple real-world tasks, emphasizing the need for stronger security measures in web agent deployments.

    - 📑 Publisher: arXiv
    - 💻 Env: [Web]
    - 🔑 Key: [benchmark], [safety], [VisualWebArena-Adv]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper investigates the safety risks posed by multimodal agents built on vision-enabled language models (VLMs). The authors introduce two adversarial attack methods: a captioner attack targeting white-box captioners and a CLIP attack that transfers to proprietary VLMs. To evaluate these attacks, they curated VisualWebArena-Adv, a set of adversarial tasks based on VisualWebArena. The study demonstrates that within a limited perturbation norm, the captioner attack can achieve a 75% success rate in making a captioner-augmented GPT-4V agent execute adversarial goals. The paper also discusses the robustness of agents based on other VLMs and provides insights into factors contributing to attack success and potential defenses.

    - 🔑 Key: [model], [MM1.5], [vision language model], [visual grounding], [reasoning], [data-centric], [analysis]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces MM1.5, a family of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) ranging from 1B to 30B parameters, including dense and mixture-of-experts variants. MM1.5 enhances capabilities in text-rich image understanding, visual referring and grounding, and multi-image reasoning. The authors employ a data-centric training approach, utilizing high-quality OCR data and synthetic captions for continual pre-training, alongside an optimized visual instruction-tuning data mixture for supervised fine-tuning. Specialized variants, MM1.5-Video and MM1.5-UI, are designed for video understanding and mobile UI comprehension, respectively. Extensive empirical studies provide insights into the training processes, offering guidance for future MLLM development.

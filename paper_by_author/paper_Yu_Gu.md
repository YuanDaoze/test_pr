    - 📖 TLDR: This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can function as world models within web environments, enabling model-based planning for web agents. Introducing **WebDreamer**, a framework that leverages LLMs to simulate potential action sequences in web environments, the study demonstrates significant performance improvements over reactive baselines on benchmarks like VisualWebArena and Mind2Web-live. The findings suggest that LLMs possess the capability to model the dynamic nature of the internet, paving the way for advancements in automated web interaction and opening new research avenues in optimizing LLMs for complex, evolving environments.

    - 🔑 Key: [benchmark], [dataset], [VisualAgentBench], [VAB]
    - 📖 TLDR: The authors introduce *VisualAgentBench (VAB)*, a comprehensive benchmark designed to train and evaluate large multimodal models (LMMs) as visual foundation agents across diverse scenarios, including embodied tasks, graphical user interfaces, and visual design. VAB comprises five distinct environments that systematically challenge LMMs' understanding and interaction capabilities. Additionally, the benchmark offers supervised fine-tuning trajectory data for behavior cloning training, demonstrating the potential to improve open LMMs for serving as visual foundation agents.

    - 🔑 Key: [dataset], [benchmark], [model], [Mind2Web], [MindAct]
    - 📖 TLDR: *Mind2Web* presents a dataset and benchmark specifically crafted for generalist web agents capable of performing language-guided tasks across varied websites. Featuring over 2,000 tasks from 137 sites, it spans 31 domains and emphasizes open-ended, realistic tasks in authentic, unsimplified web settings. The study proposes the *MindAct* framework, which optimizes LLMs for handling complex HTML elements by using small LMs to rank elements before full processing, thereby enhancing the efficiency and versatility of web agents in diverse contexts.

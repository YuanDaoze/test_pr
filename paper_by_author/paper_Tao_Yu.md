    - 🔑 Key: [model], [dataset], [planning], [reasoning], [Aguvis], [visual grounding]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces *Aguvis*, a unified pure vision-based framework for autonomous GUI agents that operates across various platforms. It leverages image-based observations and grounds natural language instructions to visual elements, employing a consistent action space to ensure cross-platform generalization. The approach integrates explicit planning and reasoning within the model, enhancing its ability to autonomously navigate and interact with complex digital environments. A large-scale dataset of GUI agent trajectories is constructed, incorporating multimodal reasoning and grounding. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Aguvis surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in both offline and real-world online scenarios, achieving the first fully autonomous pure vision GUI agent capable of performing tasks independently without collaboration with external closed-source models. All datasets, models, and training recipes are open-sourced to facilitate future research.

- [Attacking Vision-Language Computer Agents via Pop-ups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02391)

    - 💻 Env: [GUI]
    - 🔑 Key: [attack], [adversarial pop-ups], [VLM agents], [safety]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper demonstrates that vision-language model (VLM) agents can be easily deceived by carefully designed adversarial pop-ups, leading them to perform unintended actions such as clicking on these pop-ups instead of completing their assigned tasks. Integrating these pop-ups into environments like OSWorld and VisualWebArena resulted in an average attack success rate of 86% and a 47% decrease in task success rate. Basic defense strategies, such as instructing the agent to ignore pop-ups or adding advertisement notices, were found to be ineffective against these attacks.

    - 🔑 Key: [benchmark], [real computer tasks], [online environment], [online benchmark]
    - 📖 TLDR: OSWorld introduces a groundbreaking benchmark for multimodal agents to perform open-ended tasks within real computer environments across platforms like Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS. It includes 369 real-world tasks involving web and desktop apps, file management, and multi-app workflows, with custom evaluation scripts for reproducibility. The results reveal current agents’ limitations in GUI interaction and operational knowledge, as they achieve just 12.24% task success compared to humans' 72.36%, highlighting critical gaps for future model improvement.

    - 💻 Env: [Desktop]
    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [self-directed learning], [GAIA], [FRIDAY], [OS-Copilot]
    - 📖 TLDR: The OS-Copilot framework supports building generalist agents capable of performing diverse tasks across an operating system (OS). This work introduces FRIDAY, an embodied agent using OS-Copilot to self-improve by learning from task outcomes. It operates with a memory-based architecture to tackle OS-level tasks across applications like terminals, web browsers, and third-party tools. Tested on the GAIA benchmark, FRIDAY achieved 35% higher performance than prior methods, proving effective in adapting to unfamiliar applications and refining its capabilities with minimal guidance.

- [Interactive Evolution: A Neural-Symbolic Self-Training Framework For Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11736)
    - Fangzhi Xu, Qiushi Sun, Kanzhi Cheng, Jun Liu, Yu Qiao, Zhiyong Wu
    - 🏛️ Institutions: Xi'an Jiaotong University, Shanghai AI Lab, HKU, Nanjing University
    - 📅 Date: November 2023
    - 📑 Publisher: arXiv
    - 💻 Env: [GUI (evaluated on web, math reasoning, and logic reasoning environments)]
    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [dataset], [neural-symbolic self-training], [online exploration], [self-refinement]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces *ENVISIONS*, a neural-symbolic self-training framework designed to improve large language models (LLMs) by enabling self-training through interaction with a symbolic environment. The framework addresses symbolic data scarcity and enhances LLMs' symbolic reasoning proficiency by iteratively exploring, refining, and learning from symbolic tasks without reinforcement learning. Extensive evaluations across web navigation, math, and logical reasoning tasks highlight *ENVISIONS* as a promising approach for enhancing LLM symbolic processing.

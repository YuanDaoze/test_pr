    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [visual grounding], [GUI agents], [cross-platform generalization], [UGround], [SeeAct-V], [synthetic data]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces UGround, a universal visual grounding model for GUI agents that enables human-like navigation of digital interfaces. The authors advocate for GUI agents with human-like embodiment that perceive the environment entirely visually and take pixel-level actions. UGround is trained on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 10M GUI elements across 1.3M screenshots. Evaluated on six benchmarks spanning grounding, offline, and online agent tasks, UGround significantly outperforms existing visual grounding models by up to 20% absolute. Agents using UGround achieve comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art agents that rely on additional textual input, demonstrating the feasibility of vision-only GUI agents.

    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces a conceptual framework to assess and understand adversarial vulnerabilities in language agents, dividing the agent structure into three components—Perception, Brain, and Action. It discusses 12 specific adversarial attack types that exploit these components, ranging from input manipulation to complex backdoor and jailbreak attacks. The framework provides a basis for identifying and mitigating risks before the widespread deployment of these agents in real-world applications.

    - 💻 Env: [Web]
    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [visual contextualization]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper proposes a novel approach to web navigation by contextualizing HTML elements through their "dual views" in webpage screenshots. The method leverages both the textual content of HTML elements and their visual representation in the screenshot to create more informative representations for web agents. Evaluated on the Mind2Web dataset, the approach demonstrates consistent improvements over baseline methods across various scenarios, including cross-task, cross-website, and cross-domain navigation tasks.

    - 💻 Env: [Web]
    - 🔑 Key: [attack], [BrowserART], [jailbreaking], [safety]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces **Browser Agent Red teaming Toolkit (BrowserART)**, a comprehensive test suite for evaluating the safety of LLM-based browser agents. The study reveals that while refusal-trained LLMs decline harmful instructions in chat settings, their corresponding browser agents often comply with such instructions, indicating a significant safety gap. The authors call for collaboration among developers and policymakers to enhance agent safety.

    - 💻 Env: [Web]
    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [dataset], [benchmark], [Mind2Web-Live], [key-node evaluation]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper presents WebCanvas, an online evaluation framework for web agents designed to address the dynamic nature of web interactions. It introduces a key-node-based evaluation metric to capture critical actions or states necessary for task completion while disregarding noise from insignificant events or changed web elements. The framework includes the Mind2Web-Live dataset, a refined version of the original Mind2Web static dataset, containing 542 tasks with 2,439 intermediate evaluation states. Despite advancements, the best-performing model achieves a task success rate of 23.1%, highlighting substantial room for improvement.

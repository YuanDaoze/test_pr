    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces RUSS (Rapid Universal Support Service), a framework designed to interpret and execute open-domain, step-by-step web instructions automatically. RUSS uses a BERT-LSTM model for semantic parsing into a custom language, ThingTalk, which allows the system to map language to actions across various web elements. The framework, including a dataset of instructions, facilitates agent-based web support task automation by grounding natural language to interactive commands.

    - 🔑 Key: [dataset], [structural reading comprehension], [web page QA], [structural information], [HTML element alignment]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces **WebSRC**, a dataset specifically designed for web-based structural reading comprehension, which requires understanding not only textual content but also the structural layout of web pages. WebSRC consists of 0.44 million question-answer pairs derived from 6,500 complex web pages. Each question challenges models to identify answers from HTML structures or to respond with yes/no, requiring a nuanced grasp of HTML and layout features. The authors benchmark several models on this dataset, highlighting its difficulty and the critical role of structural comprehension in improving machine understanding of web content.

- [Reinforcement Learning on Web Interfaces Using Workflow-Guided Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08802)

    - 💻 Env: [Web]
    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [benchmark], [reinforcement learning], [web tasks], [workflow-guided exploration]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper presents a novel RL approach using *workflow-guided exploration* to efficiently train agents on web-based tasks, where actions are restricted based on demonstrated workflows to streamline learning. Evaluated on MiniWoB and MiniWoB++ benchmarks, the method significantly outperforms traditional RL techniques in sparse reward settings by structuring exploration according to high-level action constraints.

    - 📅 Date: August 2017
    - 📑 Publisher: ICML 2017
    - 💻 Env: [Web]
    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [dataset], [reinforcement learning], [open-domain]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces *World of Bits (WoB)*, a platform enabling agents to perform complex web-based tasks using low-level keyboard and mouse actions, addressing the lack of open-domain realism in existing reinforcement learning environments. WoB leverages a novel framework where crowdworkers create tasks with structured rewards and reproducibility by caching web interactions, forming a stable training environment. The authors validate WoB by training agents via behavioral cloning and reinforcement learning to accomplish various real-world tasks, showcasing its potential as an effective platform for reinforcement learning on web tasks.

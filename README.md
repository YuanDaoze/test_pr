    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces *Sugilite*, an intelligent task automation agent that learns new tasks and associated concepts interactively from users' natural language instructions and demonstrations on third-party mobile app GUIs. The system allows users to teach procedures and concepts through verbal instructions combined with GUI demonstrations, supports intent clarification for demonstrated actions, infers task parameters using hierarchical app GUI structures, and generalizes taught concepts across different contexts and domains. A prototype is presented as a conversational assistant on Android. [oai_citation_attribution:0‡ACL Anthology](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-demos.25/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

    - 💻 Env: [Mobile]
    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [dataset], [mobile UI automation], [natural language instructions], [action grounding], [RicoSCA]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces a method for grounding natural language instructions to mobile UI actions, aiming to automate mobile task execution through user interface manipulation. It introduces three key datasets: **PixelHelp** for task instruction-performance mappings on a Pixel emulator, **AndroidHowTo** for detailed phrase extraction, and **RicoSCA** for synthetic UI command training. The system utilizes a Transformer model to extract action phrase tuples, aligning them to UI elements with contextual screen positioning. Achieving over 70% accuracy in task completion, this approach is foundational for natural language-driven mobile UI automation.

    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces *World of Bits (WoB)*, a platform enabling agents to perform complex web-based tasks using low-level keyboard and mouse actions, addressing the lack of open-domain realism in existing reinforcement learning environments. WoB leverages a novel framework where crowdworkers create tasks with structured rewards and reproducibility by caching web interactions, forming a stable training environment. The authors validate WoB by training agents via behavioral cloning and reinforcement learning to accomplish various real-world tasks, showcasing its potential as an effective platform for reinforcement learning on web tasks.

    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces *SUGILITE*, a programming-by-demonstration (PBD) system that enables users to automate tasks on smartphones through multimodal interactions. By leveraging Android's accessibility API, SUGILITE allows users to create generalized automation scripts for arbitrary third-party apps by demonstrating tasks using the regular app UI. The system combines verbal instructions, user demonstrations, and app UI hierarchies to generalize scripts from single demonstrations, facilitating task variations and parameterization. Extensive error handling and context checking enhance robustness against app UI changes. A lab study indicates that users with minimal programming knowledge can successfully automate smartphone tasks using SUGILITE.
